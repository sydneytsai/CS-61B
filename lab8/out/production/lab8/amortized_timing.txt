Q: Is one GrowList implementation always better than the others?
A: Yes because the runtime for arithgrowlist is significantly worse than the others (based on the amortized runtime)

Q: Why is the runtime for N insertions into a geometrically resizing list a Theta(N) operation?
A: This is because the runtime for one operation is 1, which means that for N operations, it would take theta N

Q: Why is the runtime for N insertions into a arithmetically resizing list a Theta(N^2) operation?
A: This is because the runtime for one operation is already N, which means that for N operations it would be N^2

Q: How does the runtime per operation for the ArithGrowList compare to that of GeomGrowList and JavaGrowList? Specifically look at the non-accumulated plots and desribe the trends for how long each operation takes as a function of how many elements have already been inserted in the list.
A: ArithGrowList has a runtime that is N times larger than that of GeomGrowList.

Q: When are there spikes in the per operation runtime graphs for each of the implementations? Do these make sense to you? Hint: some of these should and others might not. Empirical runtime can be quite messy and depends on machine specifics which will be revealed in other subsequent classes like CS61C.
A: For geom and arith growlist, there is a steady increase per operation. However, for javagrowlist, the graph spikes when the array list is fully filled up.

Q: Optional: Try changing the code for GeomGrowList to resize by a different factor. How does this effect the theoretical asymptotic runtime? How does this effect the plotted runtime?
A:

Q: Optional: Try changing the code for ArithGrowList to resize by adding a different fixed number of spots in the array. How does this effect the theoretical asymptotic runtime? How does this effect the plotted runtime?
